	<h1> Welcome to SpoonZ! </h1>
	<h3>We offers dine in and takeout!</h3>
	<h4>Opening SpoonZ had to do with us wanting to be a part of what was happening in our great city of Windsor that we love. 
	Most importantly we wanted to give you all what you deserve! Great food, great coffee and a great atmosphere with staff that have a sense of urgency and quality.
	It's happening in a lot of great businesses in our city and it has people stopping, taking a look, and starting to talk. We have spent years honing our craft in 
	our respective areas of service, and all that while we knew weâ€™d get the chance to do what we love. The next time you dine out, we'd love for you to choose SpoonZ. 
	Let us prove to you why Spoonz is where good times happen.</h4>
